# RNA seq

## Bioinformatic analysis pipelines using RNAseq data
### 1. read quality control
### 2. reads mapping to a reference, reads alignment to longer transcripts.

## Platforms dealing with RNAseq data
### Linux: Quality control, reads mapping and reads alignment.
### R studio: a file of transcript or gene annotations(GFF, BED), a file of aligned reads(BAM)
